# Zombie Trooper

A top down shooter where you must fight off waves and waves of zombies.  See how long you can survive.

This game is programmed in Rust using the Bevy game engine.  The main purpose of designing this game was to practice using Rust and wanted to try to see if I could make a game in Bevy.

## How to Make the Game

You will need to have Rust and Cargo installed locally to make the game.  This was originally written in Rust version 1.74 and Bevy 0.11.

You can refer to here on how to install Rust and Cargo (Install Rust)[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]

Once Rust and Cargo is install you can make the game by running the command in your terminal.

```

cargo run

```

## How to Play

Use the WSAD keys to move the player and the space bar to shoot.
