# Zombie Trooper

A top down shooter where you must fight off waves and waves of zombies.  See how long you can survive.

This game is programmed in Rust using the Bevy game engine.  The main purpose of designing this game was to practice using Rust and wanted to try to see if I could make a game in Bevy.

## How to Make the Game

You will need to have Rust and Cargo installed locally to make the game.

You can refer to here on how to install Rust and Cargo (Install Rust)[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]

Once Rust and Cargo is install you can make the game by running the command in your terminal.

```

cargo run

```

## How to Play

Use the WSAD keys to move the player and the space bar to shoot.

## TODO

This game is just meant to be a small game to get me familer with Bevy so it will be a fairly small game but there are few other features I want to add before calling it done.

- [ ] More Zombies.  I said there would be waves of zombies but right now it's just one.
- [ ] UI.  Indication that you are entering a new wave of zombies.  Game Over screen.
- [ ] Restart and Quit the game.
